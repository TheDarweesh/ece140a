4. FastAPI crash course 
5. Pyramid crash course 

<h1> Overall purpose </h1>
<h3> The purpose of this assignment was to challenge us 
to learn on how to solve problems without direct help by lecture material. This forces us to learn how to start developing material without having to be guided step by step on how to accomplish certain tasks and goals.</h3>

<h1> Challenge Description </h1>
<h3> 1. Challenge 1 was a refresher in python and the lack of specific requirements to solve problems allowed us to take full advantage of Python and its resources to solve its issues rather than implenting solutions from scratch.</h3>
<h3> 2. Challenge 2 again forces us to learn by doing through creating a website using HTML & FastAPI. I used CodePen to quickly test out different CSS rulesets while utilizing Mozilla Developer Network articles to understand how to structure elements the way I wanted to. I see now how with more time and creative planning I can create websites that follow artistic rules that reliably make a website appealing.</h3>
