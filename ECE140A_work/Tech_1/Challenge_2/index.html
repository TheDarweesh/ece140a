    <p class="title">Middle East/North Africa Advocacy<p>
    <p>Role: Researcher and Presenter</p>
    <p> Highschool 2016 - Present</p>
    <p>Some of the largest mass movements of human beings stem from continious political instability in the Arab world. 
      One of the facets that I focused on during my time in activist circles in UC San Diego was the inhumane treatment of Arab refugees by many countries spanning from Eastern Europe to Britain. 
      My main method of awareness raising was hosting teach-in sessions where specific topics such as border abuse as well as focusing on the root causes of the political instablity that creates these situations.
