        <p> So I wired a motion sensor to a voice chip, and, well, 
            no sense getting all technical, 
            but it's all about positive reinforcement. Chandler, my youngest, loves it.

  <h2>My Evaluation:</h2>
  <p>My personal opinion is that I would honestly never use it. 
    Everything else aside, someone's kid is going to have to go 
    out into the world and try explain to his friends that it's 
    normal that the toilet talks to him while he's git committing. 
    I wouldn't want to put that burden on any elementary schooler. 
    This seems to me another way to offload child-rearing to technology.
